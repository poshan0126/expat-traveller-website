I spent three weeks exploring the lesser-known corners of this coastal paradise, staying in small villages where tourism hasn't yet changed the rhythm of local life.\\n\\nIn Cacela Velha, a tiny whitewashed village perched on a cliff, I found what might be the Algarve's most beautiful beach. Accessible only at low tide by wading across a lagoon, this stretch of golden sand was often completely empty despite its breathtaking beauty. The village itself, with just a handful of houses, a church, and one small restaurant serving the day's catch, offered the authentic Portugal I was seeking.\\n\\nFurther west, I discovered Benagil beyond its famous sea cave. By staying in the actual village rather than nearby Carvoeiro, I found morning solitude at spots that would be crowded by mid-day. Local fishermen recommended hidden coves accessible only by small boats or challenging footpaths, leading to private swimming spots amid spectacular rock formations.\\n\\nIn Salema, a fishing village that has maintained its character despite some tourism, I joined locals for the early morning fish auction and learned to prepare cataplana, the traditional seafood stew, from a family who had been fishing these waters for generations.\\n\\nThe real Algarve, I discovered, is found in the quiet moments: watching fishermen repair nets as the sun rises, joining locals for an espresso at a village café, or hiking ancient paths along dramatic cliffs where the only sounds are waves and birdsong.\"},{title:\"Learning to Surf at 35\",image:\"/images/stories/surfing.jpg\",alt:\"Surfing in Bali\",category:\"Adventure\",excerpt:\"From complete beginner to riding waves in Bali, this journey taught me it's never too late to challenge yourself...\",fullStory:\"I always thought surfing was something you had to start as a teenager—a sport where the learning curve was too steep to begin in your thirties. But during a month-long stay in Bali, I decided to challenge that assumption. On my first day, struggling just to carry the longboard to the beach, I wondered if I'd made a terrible mistake.\\n\\nThe initial lessons were humbling. While teenagers and twenty-somethings popped up on their boards with apparent ease, I spent hours just trying to paddle out past the break without being thrown back to shore. My body ached in places I didn't know could ache. But my instructor Made, a patient Balinese surfer who'd been riding waves since childhood, assured me that persistence would pay off.\\n\\nHe was right. On my seventh day, I caught my first real wave, managing to stand up for a brief, exhilarating moment before tumbling into the white water. That feeling—the brief sense of flying as the wave propelled me forward—was addictive enough to keep me coming back despite the failures.\\n\\nBy week three, something clicked. My body began to understand the rhythm of the ocean, anticipating rather than reacting to the waves. I started catching more waves than I missed, staying up long enough to actually maneuver the board a little.\\n\\nOn my final week, I graduated from the beginner's beach to an intermediate spot called Batu Bolong. There, surrounded by surfers of all ages (though still one of the oldest beginners), I caught the wave that made all the bruises and saltwater sinuses worthwhile—a long, smooth ride where time seemed to slow down, where I wasn't thinking about technique but simply experiencing the pure joy of being carried by the ocean's energy.\\n\\nLearning to surf at 35 reminded me that the artificial limitations we place on ourselves are often just that—artificial. Now back home, far from tropical waters, I still find myself checking surf forecasts and planning my next ocean adventure.\"}]},about:{background:\"/images/backgrounds/about.jpg\",title:\"The Journey Behind the Lens\",subtitle:\"From corporate life to global nomad, discover the story that drives my adventures.\",profile:{image:\"/images/profile.jpg\",name:\"The Expat Traveller\",bio:[\"Five years ago, I left my corporate job to pursue my passion for travel and photography.
